As '''cyberware''' (also: '''cyberimplants''', ugs.: '''chrome''', '''wires''') refers to inorganic, technical [[augmentations]] implanted in the body for medical reasons, but far more often to improve or enhance physical and mental abilities. Cyberware implants can interact with the body in complex ways. The example of a cyberhand that today easily masters interaction with motor nerves demonstrates the great progress made in the field of {{WP|Medical_cybernetics|Medical cybernetics}}, from whose name cyberware is also derived, since its humble beginning as an idea in the science fiction novels of the previous century.

In addition to [[humans]] and [[metahumans]], [[critter|paracritter]] and animals are also equipped with cyberware, ultimately leading to the program-controlled or remote-controlled [[biodrones]].

==History==
Although the first simple prostheses were made as early as 2000 years before the birth of Christ, and by the turn of the last millennium pacemakers and prostheses that could be moved by muscle contractions were nothing special, it was still a long way to the current cyberware.

Some historians begin the history of cyberware {{shx|1982}}, with the successful insertion of a heart replacement pump called {{WPE|Artificial_heart#First_clinical_applications_of_a_permanent_pneumatic_total_artificial_heart|Jarvic-7}} into a [[Norm|human]] Patient. For many, however, this heart - which was anything but a success of medicine - is still too primitive.

The prosthesis, generally considered the first true cyberware implant in history, was {{Shx|2019}} made by the [[Transys Neuronet|Transys Corporation]]. It replaced the left hand of professional violinist [[Leonora Bartoli]]. This novel prosthetic hand was directly connected to the patient's nervous system, allowing it to be used like a normal hand. The cyberware boom began, and quickly all major [[corporations]] began to enter cyberware research. To this day, cyberware research is one of the most hotly contested research fields around.

Over time, cyberware became more socially accepted, and in some circles chrome, as it is often called, was even considered chic, although this depended heavily on the cultural context. By the {{shx|2050s}}, cyberware had become a basic requirement in many security and military occupations. However, there were significant headwinds against employer-mandated cybering, and {{shx|2050}} the [[Lone Star|Lone Star Security Services Corporation]] lost a high-profile lawsuit against the requirement that every Lone Star employee have a smartlink implanted.

Still, that didn't really stop cyberware, either in the broad consumer sector or in the much more specialized (and expensive) security and military sectors. In the {{shx|2060s}} cyberware gradually lost the smell of the new, radical, habituation set in, and first [[bioware]] then [[geneware]], then [[nanoware]] became the new, hot thing everyone was controversially discussing.

Today, cyberware has long been a fact of life. It is still synonymous with [[augmentations]], even though it has long since ceased to be the thing that is talked about much. Minor [[augmentations]] like [[data jacks]]s and [[cybereyes]] are as common today as cell phones were in the {{shx|2000s}}, and just as much something no one thinks much about anymore. Cyberware is everyday life.

==Mode of operation==
Cyberware was first made possible by findings in the field of [[nanite]] research in the {{shx|2010s}}. With newly developed [[nanophages]] called [[nanites]], it was possible to connect the electronic circuits of the implants to the nerves of the wearer, allowing direct control of the cyberware by the brain. The electricity needed to power the implants is largely generated by the body itself. Larger implants, however, use a small nucleotide-phosphate processing fuel cell or integrated batteries as an additional power source.
{{Shadowtalk|Yes, [[Chummer]]. And that means your Chrome is eating, man!|'''''{{shx|ScareCrow}}'''''}}

Further, whenever possible, cyberware is made only from materials that are neither rejected by the body nor attacked in the body's chemically active environment to avoid excessive immune reactions and short implant lifetimes. Common materials include ecto-myelins, pseudo-organic ceramics, and coating the parts of the cyberware exposed to the body with body-like proteins.
{{shadowtalk|This also largely avoids the need for immunosuppressants, such as [[Cybertram]] or [[SANDIMMUN PLUS|<sup>s</sup>IMMUN+<sup>Â®</sup>]], except to avoid immediate complications during implantation. Unless, of course, you get involved with [[Omegaware]], and then have to swallow the chemical bombers for the rest of your life. - But who does that to themselves?|'''''[[Macha]]'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|Who cares, buckle? As long as my blade is out of hand when I need it, I don't care where the power comes from. Or what pills I have to swallow to get it.|'''''{{shx|Orphan}}'''''}}
==Implantation==
Many [[bodyshop]]s in malls (and also [[street doc]]s and [[shadow clinic]]s) make their living primarily from cyberware, especially minor procedures like implanting [[cybereyes]] and [[data jack]]s. [[Cybereyes]] are now cheaper than surgical eye correction, and with the fast turnaround at consumer surgery clinics, it's also quicker and usually without the hassle of scheduling appointments. And if you like it more discreet, turn to [[black clinic]]s or [[corporate]]clinics.

For more information, see the article on [[implant surgery]].

==Why chrome?==
Of all [[augmentations]], cyberware has the longest history. And for a long time, it looked like chrome would go the way of medical prosthetics and wooden legs. [[Bioware]], [[Genware]], and [[Nanoware]] were more elegant, less invasive, and becoming cheaper and more available.

But with the [[KFS]] crisis, the new stars in the [[augmentation|augmentation]] sky fell, for suddenly they were the starting point of a plague, and much of what had been achieved was lost as entire research complexes were wiped out, knowledge died irretrievably with its bearers, and more disappeared into archives as governments and [[corporations]] realized the extent of the crisis.

Now chrome is back.

===Advantages===
Even if [[transhumanism|transmetahumanists]] and [[corporate]]-[[vat job]]s think cyberware is water under the bridge, there is something to be said for Chrome. While it is the case that cyberware is now around 50 years in the market. Cyberware is old tech. Cyberware has lost a lot of the wow factor of the {{shx|2040s}} and {{shx|2050s}}.

However, it is still the safe alternative if you want to [[augment|Augment]]. Moreover, modern cyberware of the {{shx|2070s}} is a boon, remembering the days of ill-fitting, non-functional prosthetics. Thanks to modern [[cyberlimb]]s, the loss of a hand or leg, or even of [[cyberoptics|eyesight]] due to accident or war injury, no longer has to mean being crippled for the rest of one's life. The fitting and implantation of a [[cyberhand]], [[cyberarm]] or [[cyberleg|leg]] is routine in most cases - provided, of course, that one can afford it.

And finally, cyberware is inexpensive, available, and mature. Neither do you need the kind of care that prototype treatment entails, nor do you have to find vast sums of money somewhere to afford [[augmentations]]. [[Omegaware]] is in every backyard. Cyberware is street. Cyberware is what the mass of the inhabitants of the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]] use. Sure, privileged-born [[mages]] and heavily wealthy [[Johnny Spinrad]] wannabes turn up their noses at it. But a [[spur|cyberspur]] kills them just as much as the most advanced [[nanoware]] in the labs of [[megacorporations]].

====availabilityandcost====
Most legal (and also most illegal) cyberware [[augmentations]] are cheap and readily available, and therefore offer good value for money. [[Bioware]] and [[Nanoware]] alternatives usually cost twice or more of a comparable cyberware. This, of course, makes cyberware very attractive especially to people who don't have as much money as military, corporate mercenaries, or [[execs]]. [[Gangers]] and [[SIN]]loos working their way up in the [[Shadows]] can't get around cyberware any more than ordinary soldiers or cops. Corporate [[Sararimen|wage slaves]] also prefer to use the cheap cyberware rather than expensive [[genware]].

This was not always the case. As recently as the {{shx|2050s}}, cyberware was expensive and not found at all much in the [[barrens]], but as production costs dropped, so did prices, and in the {{shx|2070s}}, chrome is much more prevalent among [[gangers]]s and [[Shadowrunner|beginner runners]]. Likewise, the drop in prices of [[talent lines]] and the proliferation of [[talentsoft#talentsoft matrix services|talentsoft streaming services]] have ensured an entire class of [[sararimen|corporate workers]] are heavily wired.

And [[data jacks]], [[cyber eyes]] and [[cosmetic cyberware]] are commonplace.

====Beherrschbarkeit====
Cyberware is a known and mastered technology. It was the first form of true [[augmentations|augmentation]], and has become better understood and continuously refined and improved since its introduction in the {{shx|2020s}}. Today's cyberware designs are the result of decades of learning. [[Cyberlimbs]], [[Cyberoptics]], Cyber-[[Headware]] are easy to obtain and install, and safer than most [[Bioware]] or [[Genware]] equivalents.

Sure, newly introduced implants still need customization and have quirks, but most cyberware [[augmentations]] have been on the market for years or decades and have grown out of the early, not-quite-understood stage. When you get [[cyberoptics]], a [[data jack]], or a [[FSE|rigger control]] implanted, you know what you're getting, know the risks, and can manage them.

Cyberware has also been available long enough that implantation and maintenance technology are also long past most teething problems and bugs. Cyberware also requires little [[nanotechnology]] and has low vulnerability to attack by [[KFS|KI nanite swarms]].

====Robustness====
And along with familiarity and mastery comes the fact that cyberware is easy to maintain and repair when in doubt. [[KFS]] has clearly demonstrated to the world the dangers of [[nanoware]] - if nanotechnology doesn't want to go your way, there's little that can be done. Cyberware is different - there is manufacturer support, there are many cybertechs who have decades of experience dealing with cyberware, there are standard treatments available spare parts. And then there is the fact that cyberware is often simply more robust than organic alternatives.

While [[bioware]] is basically just manipulated flesh and bone, cyberware is made of well known and reality tested plastic materials, polymers and myomers, ceramics and body resistant non-corroding alloys, insulated microelectronics components, fiber optic cables and optical computers, microgyroscopes and electric motors. This simply makes them more robust than flesh, whose limitations cannot be circumvented even by bioware. [[Cyberarms]] can certainly reach into flames without danger - cooling systems prevent them from transferring heat to the flesh they're paired with, at least for a while - and the ability to turn off components means you can ignore nasty sensor inputs. And repair is significantly faster and often no less difficult than waiting for (and if) flesh to heal back up.
{{shadowtalk|Unless, of course, you include [[healing magic]] in the consideration.|'''''{{shx|Spirit}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|Not everyone has a personal healing mage or can afford a [[mage]] to take care of every ache.|'''''[[apeman]]'''''}}

====Vielseitigkeit====
Although more invasive than many of these alternatives, cyberware [[augmentations]] are also more versatile and customizable - already what is possible in the realm of [[cosmetic cyberware|cosmetic cyberware]] is nearly impossible to achieve with other methods. And that is by no means all that cyberware can do.

Especially since the most pressing problem has long been solved. Initially, powering cyberware was still a major problem, and early implant wearers were forced to carry around heavy and clunky batteries. Soon, however, a solution was found: Using new superconducting materials, it was possible to capture the bioelectricity generated by the body and, in the case of energy-hungry implants, even to retrieve it from more remote areas of the body.
{{shadowtalk|Which, of course, can usually lead to real feeding frenzies.|'''''{{shx|ScareCrow}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|That's nothing against some [[Bioware]]implants!|'''''[[Apeman]]'''''}}

It's just that machines can do some things that flesh will never be able to do. This doesn't mean being stronger, faster and more effective, but the full rotational capability of a gear as well as the density and damage resistance of ceramet materials, energy effects like lasers and interaction with radio and maser signals. Biological components simply cannot do these things. There are no alternatives to some cyberware systems, and that's not because it's never been tried, it's just that some things are difficult to replicate with [[bioware]], [[geneware]], or [[nanoware]]. There is, for example, no alternative to data jacks, or [[orientation system]]s, or [[FSE|rigger controls]]. Only cyberware can provide such services.

===Disadvantages===
Of course, cyberware does not have only advantages. In fact, it has significant side effects and disadvantages compared to other forms of [[Augmentations|Augmentation]]. Everything has a price, and chrome is really no exception.
[[File:Cyberwar damage.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Cyberwar damage or malfunction can become very uncomfortable, painful, and sometimes acutely life-threatening for both the wearer and those around them.<br/>{{C Fanpro|FanPro LLC}} (<u>Copyright:</u> Tom Fowler)]]
====Vulnerability to Hacking====
Cyberware is Tech. Most cyberware is [[WiFi matrix|WiFi-active]]. On the one hand, this is its great strength and important for many of its unique functions. On the other hand, it is also a great vulnerability, especially in times of [[WiFi matrix]].

Cyberware can be hacked. This is a sad fact and perhaps the most dangerous drawback, at least in the short term. It is possible to protect against this - within the limits set by technology - but it is something to be aware of. Besides, it's not something Joe and Jane [[SIN]]ners worry about much, any more anyway than hacks of their autonomous car or their smart home. But for those in the [[shadow]] - and in the military and security industries - it's a big problem.

One way out is to attach as little cyberware to the matrix as possible. The [[cyberware router]] provides a reasonably well-functioning solution to this. If only interconnectivity is needed, the router is a good and hard to hack alternative to the [[PAN]]. However, a lot of cyberware derives a good part of its functionality from evaluating external data - for example, the [[orientation system]] or the [[FSE|riggerconrole]] both of which gain considerably when communicating via the matrix. In the latter case, the only thing that helps is to secure yourself with as good a [[firewall]] as possible and hope for the best. Sorry, [[Chummer]], isso.

====RegularMaintenance====
Unlike [[bioware]], [[geneware]] or [[nanoware]] (with a [[nanite hatcher]]), cyberware does not have a self-healing function and is therefore subject to wear and tear not only when damaged, but also in everyday life, which cannot be easily restored. Cyberware needs maintenance. The functional benchmarks of modern cyberware are guaranteed by the manufacturer with good reason only with regular maintenance. For the vast majority of implants, this is an annual diagnostic cycle; for some systems - such as [[cyberoptics]] and [[reflex boosters]]s - the intervals are shorter; for others - such as [[composite bones]] and [[cybertorsos and cyberskulls]]s - the cycles are longer. As a rule of thumb, more complex, more powerful cyberware requires more maintenance than basic systems.

In addition, cyberware is definitely subject to the update cycles of the tech industry. True, the product cycle is longer - no one gets their skull sawed open every six months, even if hardly any [[SIN]]ers think about the [[commlink]] being exchanged for a new one "for free" every six months. But firmware updates, security patches and the like affect cyberware like all tech. And that can definitely be a problem, especially in the [[shadows]].

For standard cyberware this is not much of a problem (and for [[Omegaware]] it doesn't matter anyway) but for better categories of cyberware this may well not be easy, as maintenance ideally needs to be done by competent people. A [[street doc]] may be able to gaze at [[Deltaware]] (and possibly try to steal it from the wearer), but meaningful updates or maintenance is hard to do with the limited resources of a backyard clinic. Even in a legal [[bodyshop]] in the mall, such implants will only be looked at in disbelief. [[Delta clinic]]s are rare, and the vast majority are owned by a megacorporation. Whoever wants to have his [[Deltaware]] competently serviced, therefore, either belongs to that, or has some arrangement.

Less drastic, but still similar, is the situation with [[Betaware]]. Here, however, it is enough to have contacts in a good clinic. As for [[Gammaware]] - there are no maintenance routines for that yet. These are prototypes in alpha test stage. But the values of malfunctions of such radical cyberware are certainly welcome by megacorporations, since they allow conclusions about design and function. But even the actual manufacturer probably can't help.

====legality====
The control of technology also has its downsides. The mills of the law grind slowly. While many an experimental [[nanoware]] and even some [[genware|gen-]] and [[bioware]] are simply still too new, lawmakers have had decades to deal with cyberware. As a result, cyberware is much more tightly regulated than [[SOTA]]. Cyberware may now be acceptable among the general population - but the [[police|cops]] always keep an eye on heavily [[Vercybert]]ed ones. "Driving/Walking/Existing-While-Cybered" is still almost as good a reason for a 'random traffic stop' as Driving-While-Ork.

Many cyberimplants are perfectly legal and can be safely carried in public. Of course, the legality of many implants still does not mean that it would be legitimate to use them for illegal things ([[Data Jack]]s for [[Decker|Cybercrime]] and [[BTL]] consumption, [[Contraband Container|Body Container]] for [[Smuggling]], [[Rigger Control]]s for [[Autoduellist|Autoduellist]]).

Others, and these are often the ones of interest to [[Shadowrunner]]s, were explicitly designed for combat and are thus more legally problematic. And there, many security agencies know little fun. At least licenses are necessary here. Even if you own [[Artificial Muscle]] as a construction worker, you already need two - one for possession, one for carrying and using in the context of work. Like other licenses, these should be both tied to a [[SIN]] and in a plausible context (Bob the Plumber is more likely to have no need for a [[Reflex Booster]]).

In general, [[cyberweapon]]s are universally illegal, except for [[police|security organizations]] and [[military]], and in the few states that allow [[lethal sports|bloodsports]]. Military (such as [[Reflex Booster]]) or security-classified (such as a [[Smartlink]]) ones are, depending on the country, more readily available and also more easily explained: no one assumes that a [[Mercenary|Elite Mercenary]] of the [[MET 2000]] will unscrew his [[Cyberarm]] gyrostabilizer while off-duty. On the other hand, anyone off duty with an unsealed [[cyberweapon|cyberarm]] is certain to be arrested upon discovery.

Add to that the fact that cyberware now has a street, [[ganger|gang]], and underclass connotation - aside from everyday augmentations. And since an individual's combat power can be vastly enhanced by cyberimplants, a lot of illegal cyberware is naturally found in the [[shadows]]. Entire sectors of organized crime make their money only by trading used and stolen cyberware. Accordingly, one should camouflage one's restricted or even non-legal cyberware well and have a good explanation when it shows up in a cyberware scanner. However, it is often not clear to a layman what kind of implant one is dealing with, so it is quite possible (and common) in [[shadow]] circles to simply specify in fake [[SIN]]s similar [[augmentation]]s that are less illegal, such as a medical nerve prosthesis instead of a [[move-by-wire system]].

====Invasiveness====
Cyberware encumbers the metahuman body. [[Metahumans]] are just not made to be connected to electromechanical components. Such internals are too alien and different, and the body often resists them and has greater acceptance problems than with [[bioware]], [[geneware]], or [[nanoware]].  Users of [[Omegaware]] often even have to take permanent medication to prevent rejection. New implants have a good chance of complications in the direction of even high quality ones, and for a transitional period, drugs like [[cybertram]] are normal.

And then there is the fact that many users experience alienation, because even the meta-human mind does not cope well with every technological enhancement. It is important to note here that the attitude of the person is very important. Someone who accepts and embraces implants - often because they were consciously chosen - has less risk of such mental rejection than someone who associates cyberware with trauma - an accident, for example.
{{shadowtalk|Every cybertech can tell stories of patients who have torn their new cybereyes out of their skulls, wantonly destroyed their cyberlimbs, or tried to get rid of data jacks or other implants with knives, forks, and spoons. An estimated one in twenty simply can't handle cyberware. And that's not just mages and ecos. Sure, some already reject the basic idea, like Amish, but many don't realize there's a problem until they have the metal and plastic in their bodies and feel how wrong it feels to them. And then they go crazy.|'''''[[Doc.Wunderlich]]'''''}}

====Essenzverlust====
The more flesh, skin, bone, and muscle a [[metahuman]] has replaced with chrome, ceramic, and plast, the more they lose a part of their living self. This is commonly referred to as the loss of [[essence]], the nature of which, however, eludes scientific interpretation even after decades. More about this in the article about [[essence]].

What is certain is that loss of essence leads to massive psychological and psychosomatic problems, even death. Owners of many cyberimplants are often described as easily irritable, impatient, cold-tempered and incapable of social contact, there is a tendency to {{WP|Sociopathy}}. It is also referred to as [[cyberpsychosis]] due to its proven causality.
{{Shadowtalk|Who wrote this? I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch! '''''[[Raptor]]'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|q.e.d.|'''''{{shx|Spirit}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|man, get humor implanted.|'''''[[Raptor]]'''''}}
{{Shadowtalk|If that's true, I'd have to carry a hell of a lot of cyberware. At least judging by what the guys around me are saying.|'''''{{shx|Blank}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|What's the problem chummer? Is everything right.|'''''{{shx|Linc}}'''''}}

It is also certain that too much loss of food is fatal. Irretrievable.
{{shadowtalk|Or at least ... almost. But [[cybermantie]] is not a good idea.|'''''[[Raptor]]'''''}}

One piece of good news, however, is that [[essence]] loss is now correctable. The corresponding [[Gene Therapy#Revitalization|Gene Therapies]] are expensive, time-consuming, and require the removal of interfering [[Augmentations]], but with enough (lots and lots of) [[Nuyen]] and time, one can at least repair the damage to the [[Aura]]. Whether that can be done to the psyche of the (formerly) [[Augmentations|Augmented]] is another matter.

====Diseases triggered by cyberware====
Cyberware is bad for mental and physical health. This is now a generally accepted fact - only corporate PR agencies and some lunatic [[transhumanist]]s claim otherwise.

[[Cyberware]] (and also [[bioware]]) can permanently unbalance a user's immune system. The [[augmentation]]s are not accepted by every user, and the body permanently perceives them as foreign bodies and resists them, which then needs to be treated with medication. This treatment in turn weakens the immune system as a whole.

{{Main article|cyberpsychosis}}
As the [[vercybert|vercyberation]] progresses, the person in question also loses more and more of their humanity, which is often reflected in progressive emotional coldness and detachment in heavily [[street samurai]]s and other severely [[vercybert|vercyberated]]s. This is a classic [[cyberpsychosis]], a mental disorder caused by augmentations (hence the name, though historically grown, is somewhat unfair).

{{main article|TLE-x}}
Another common disorder is TLE-X, temporal lobe epilepsy with complications. Primarily, but not exclusively, triggered by [[move-by-wire system]]s, this severe, degenerative brain disease can be treated in the early stages with [[AEXD]] medication and later with brain surgery and [[gene therapy|gent therapy]] agents, but in the final stages it is incurable.

{{Main article|CCSS}}
Unlike TLE-x, CCSS is a primarily [[move-by-wire system]]-induced disorder. In this, large portions of the brain's motor center and perceptual functions cease to function, overloaded by the constant impulses of the implant. Therapy is possible, but long-term, and success is by no means assured. In addition, removal of the move-by-wire system is a prerequisite.

==Categories of cyberware==
There are thousands of cyberware implants in the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]]. In order to keep track and order, they are categorized in various ways. Among them, the usual categorizations are by the quality of the implants and their function.

===Quality categories===
Cyberware is produced in different quality categories, which differ in their effects on the (meta-)human body and in their processing quality. Although research in this field is still going on at full speed, the implantation of cyberware is still a delicate process. The [[metahuman|(meta-)human]] Body is not designed to accommodate additional augmentations. Therefore, especially with slightly larger implants, it is often necessary to remove tissue or even bone to make room.
{{Shadowtalk|I've been saying this all along, but no one listens to me. The human body is good the way it is. There is simply no more room for chrome. Just the thought of someone drilling a hole in my skull bone to insert a [[data jack]] makes me gag.|'''''{{shx|Spirit}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|People like you make me really consider donating to a Mage Hater policy club. Just wallow in your privilege and give nerdy advice, you Drekheads.|'''''[[Raptor]]'''''}}
{{Shadowtalk|You're just jealous because you can't afford to be better than them.|'''''{{shx|Popeye}}'''''}}
{{Shadowtalk|You're too weak and can't do any more? No problem. Use cyberware! Oh yeah Spirit: pain is part of the job|'''''{{shx|Linc}}'''''}}

However, there are different quality levels of cyberware that at least mitigate this problem somewhat. Due to the fact that complicated nanites are required in the creation of the neural connections, an experienced [[nanoware]]specialist should also be present during the operation to oversee this process.
{{Shadowtalk|Yes, "should". Since [[Shadowrunner]]s usually have their implants put in, you'll be lucky if the guy who's snipping away at you has even studied medicine.|'''''{{shx|Grease}}'''''}}

The quality of cyberware is roughly recorded in six cathegories - alpha to gamma (via delta) and omega. They are various gradations of good or not so good materials, quality of workmanship, and complexity of implants. A special form ofOmegaware is used cyberware, which is technically mostly of standard or alphaware quality, but has already been implanted in and adapted to another user.

Depending on the severity of the surgery and the complexity of the implant, such an operation may be performed on an outpatient basis, or may entail a rehabilitation period of up to several weeks.
{{Shadowtalk|In the latter case, the word on the street is a vat job... because most of the rehabilitation time is spent in a tank of nutrient solution.|'''''{{shx|Interpreter}}'''''}}

====Standardcyberware====
Standard off-the-shelf cyberware. [[Standard cyberware]] implants are mass produced and can be had comparatively cheaply. However, they are therefore also poorly tailored to the user, invasive, and thus have relatively strong effects on the balance between the body and [[aura]], and result in severe [[essence]] loss. Implantation, however, is simple, standardized like the implants, and thanks to helpful [[AR]] guides, feasible even for [[street doc|backyard medic]]s without necessarily causing the prospective wearer's exitus.

More on this in the [[Standardcyberware|corresponding article]].

====Alphaware====
[[Alphaware]] is manufactured according to much stricter quality guidelines than normal cyberware. It is made of more biocompatible materials that have less impact on the body, is produced in small quantities, and is at least partially custom-made. Due to higher material costs and partial customization, Alphaware is significantly more expensive than standard cyberware. However, the effects on the balance between body and [[aura]] are much less severe. Not only does it mean less drastic damage to the aura, it also increases the relative amount of implants a user can carry until psychic damage occurs, or even the essence zero point is reached and death occurs.

More about this [[Alphaware|in the corresponding article]].

====Betaware====
[[Betaware]], unlike Alphaware, is custom cyberware. It is not first produced and then sold, but can only be made to order. Betaware is precisely tailored to the customer's body chemistry and physiology, and like Alphaware, is made from only the finest materials. Because of these limitations, Betaware is difficult to obtain outside the upper class and except for corporate citizens.

More on this in the [[Betaware|related article]].

====Deltaware====
[[Deltaware]] was for many years - the {{shx|2050s}} and the {{shx|2060s}} - a myth. Only the few [[delta clinic]]s of the megacons could manufacture and implant them. This is still true today, but now almost every [[Sprawl]] of note has a Delta Clinic, the procedures are known and understood, and there are even branded Deltaware small series.

More on this in the [[Deltaware|related article]].

====Gammaware====
Officially, Gammaware doesn't even exist yet. It's the new hot thing, the Deltaware of the late {{shx|2070s}} and {{shx|2080s}}. Supposedly [[Evo]] has them. Possibly [[MCT]] and [[Universal Omnitech]] as well. And there are rumors about the mysterious cult-like conglomerate [[Zion Amalgamated]] from [[Ethiomalian_Regions|Ethnomalia]]. But no one knows anything more specific. It is still experimental, but it is the next major evolutionary step of Chrom.

More about this in the [[Gammaware|corresponding article]].

====Omegaware====
Omegaware is the cyberware of the street. Where [[Gammaware]] is the latest hottest thing, [[Omegaware]] is the latest drek. Discount cyberware, replicas of cyberware three product generations ahead of the curve.  Made in sweatshops, under dubious conditions, from very dubious materials, resulting in a terrible product. If you're lucky. If you're not, you get used cyberware, unsanitary and, because it's configured for someone else, especially INCOMPATIBLE. But also particularly cheap. And that is the deciding factor for many. So they can afford at least some [[Augmentations|Augmentation]].
{{shadowtalk|[[Omegaware]] is thus the new ''used cyberware''. Nothing like a nice ''rebranding'' ...|'''''[[Raptor]]'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|Not quite. Used chrome still exists and costs more essence due to preload. Omegaware is enweder leftover prototype, intentional cheap goods, goods with restrictions to manipulate the wearer such as a cyberarm that refuses to go after Ares citizens, or just crappy quality.|'''''[[Mercy]]'''''}}
More on the topic in the [[Omegaware|corresponding article]].

===Functional categories===
In addition to their quality, cyberware can also be categorized by their function. Cyberware is nowadays divided into six categories determined by its function as well as its location in the body, although this division is fluid and constantly changing, just as cyberware is always evolving and differentiating.

====Cosmetic Cyberware====
This category covers all technical or largely inorganic [[augmentations]] that do not have a primarily functional use, but rather [[augment|augment]] the appearance of the user. In addition to age-old acquaintances such as [[breast implants]]s, this includes [[cybergenitalia]]s, modern body jewelry such as [[LED tattoos]], and horns, studs, and spikes that are more for ornamentation than combat.

More on this in the [[cosmetic cyberware|corresponding article]].

====Headware====
Cyberware that resides in the head is most commonly referred to as headware. Usually its function is to expand in some way the user's mental capacities or to provide interfaces for communication.

More about this in the [[Headware|corresponding article]].

====Senseware====
Senseware refers to all those implants that sharpen or enhance the user's senses. For example, implants such as [[cyberoptics]] and [[cyberears]] fall under this category, as well as new senses such as radar sensors.
{{Shadowtalk|Not to mention the ever-popular [[Smell Enhancer|Cybersniffer]] or cyber trunk, which gives you a more powerful sense of smell than a trained sheepdog possesses.|'''''{{shx|StarCut}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|If you have one of these, you better not serve soy chili for lunch.|'''''{{shx|McMan}}'''''}}
Senseware is a subcategory of [[headware]]. For more on this, see the [[Senseware|corresponding article]].

====Bodyware====
All cyberware that does not reside in the patient's head is called bodyware. It usually enhances the physical properties of the body, for example by making it faster, stronger, or more resilient. Examples include [[composite bone]], [[artificial muscle]], or [[dermal armor]]. Other bodyware that adds functionality would include the [[biomonitor]], the [[internal air tank|air tank]], or the subdermal induction pads that interface with the [[smartgun]] system.

More on bodyware in the [[bodyware|corresponding article]].

====CybergliedmaÃen====
Unlike normal cyberware, [[cyberlimb]]s do not augment certain physical traits or abilities, but rather swap entire body parts with artificial replacements. Most often, they are used for reconstruction after an accident in which the natural limb was lost, but some individuals voluntarily replace parts of their bodies with the artificial equivalents. Because cyber limbs are an enormous intrusion on the integrity of the body, they usually entail an enormous [[essence]]loss. In addition to normal [[cyberarm]]s and [[cyberleg]]s, there are also [[cybertorsos and cyberskulls]].

For more on cyberlimbs, see the [[cyberlimbs|corresponding article]].

====cyberweapons====
The final category is cyberweapons. This refers to all types of cutting, stabbing, and firing weapons that can be implanted, from [[nail knife]]s to [[eye weapon]]s and [[skull bomb|cortex bomb]]s to [[cybergun]]s. [[Raptor Claws]] and [[Projectile Spurs]]s also fall under this, but not [[Composite Bones]], although these also have potential as weapons, as they were not primarily developed as weapons, but to strengthen the skeleton.

For more on cyberweapons, see the [[Cyberweapons|corresponding article]].

==Boundary areas==
Cyberware has permeated all areas of the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]], and in some cases stretched the limits of what is possible. In addition to the quite broadly applied [[vercybert|vercyberation]] of animals, attempts are being made to combine cyberware with [[critter]]s, intelligent magical beings, and [[MMVV|infected]]s with mixed success.

And you can even cheat death with cyberware. But at a tremendous cost.

===Cyberware and Awakened===
Even in controversial areas, cyberware is used surprisingly often. While any [[Essence]] loss immediately negatively affects [[Awakened]]s ability to manipulate [[Mana]]. This can even cause them to lose [[Spell|this ability]] completely - forever, irretrievably. However, not all schools of magic are completely closed to [[augmentations]]. Some see benefits for mages in some degree of [[augmentations]]: [[cyberoptics]] greatly improve the effectiveness of directly cast spells - which depend on the caster's eye contact. Intelligence-enhancing implants such as [[encephalon]]s also show useful effects for [[mage|magic caster]]s, as do some [[bioware]]s.

But it is a dance on a knife's edge, and such cybermages fall faster than they would like. They are then referred to as ''[[burnout]]'' or the ''path of burnout''. Heavily [[vercybert]]ed [[magically gifted]]s are therefore rarely still magically active.
{{shadowtalk|The path of the [[Augmentations|Augmented]] is unnatural. The world itself looks with disgust upon those who tread it.|'''''[[Dances-in-the-Matrix]]'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|I've been saying that all along, but all the wireheads don't want to hear it ...|'''''{{shx|Spirit}}'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|All the wireheads just aren't into it when [[mages]] tell them to shut the fuck up and know their place in the world.|'''''[[Raptor]]'''''}}

Nevertheless, this form of optimization based on cost-benefit calculations is quite popular in the corporate world. The same is true for [[Ki Adept|Body Adept]]s.

===Cyberware and Technomancers===
Cyberware is also problematic for [[technomancer]]s, as it limits their connection to [[resonance]]s - much like [[mage]]s ability to [[mana]] manipulation. This is an added penalty for many technomancers who awoke after the Crash, since a decker - and even an [[otaku]] - ]] was, after all, at least dependent on an [[ASIST]] interface, usually a [[data jack]].

Nevertheless, moderate [[vercybert|vercyberation]] for technomancers also has advantages. Namely, certain [[headware]] that increases mental abilities has a positive effect on their [[persona|living persona]].

===Cyberware and MMVV infected===
[[Vampire]]s cannot have any cyberware implanted at all except [[Deltaware]], as their regenerative abilities inevitably lead to rejection.  

More on this in the [[Cyberware and Vampires|corresponding article]].

For [[ghouls]] like the pirate [[Scavanger]], on the other hand, [[cybereyes]] are a good way to overcome the blindness associated with their [[MMVV]] infection - as long as they can find a [[street doc|doc]] willing to operate on a ghoul. Although pre-infection chromium can be damaged when transforming from a [[metahuman|(meta-human)]] into a ghoul, and [[bioware]] is completely absorbed during the transformation, these dual beings tolerate cyberimplants with surprising ease, even if it costs them significantly more essence than non-infected ones.

===Cyberware and Paracritters===
[[Shapeshifter]]s can pick up [[Deltaware]] (like other [[Critter]]s with regenerative abilities), but this prevents them from using their shapeshifting ability and locks them into their current form. Accordingly, shapeshifters are not very fond of Deltaware either.

[[Drakes]] can absorb cyberware, but when they assume their non-human form, it disappears and has no function for them. Interestingly, and unlike [[shapeshifter]]s, the [[metahuman|metahuman]] body of the Drake reshapes upon reversion, along with all [[augmentations]].

[[Dragons]] are incapable of absorbing any type of [[augmentation]]. The only known exception is the [[Western Dragon|Western Dragon]] [[Eliohann]], who had a [[data jack]] specially constructed for him inserted. Unfortunately, the dragon died as a result of the [[Crash 2.0|Second Crash]]. No other cyberdragons are known, but other experiments have failed. Most dragons make use of the [[Matrix]] by donning [[trodnet]]s constructed specifically for them, and otherwise rely on their dragon magic as they have for decades.

===Cyberware and animals===
Animals and non-intelligent [[critter]]s are frequent recipients of cyberware. There is a thriving branch of cybering all types of animals. Not only as test subjects and carriers of [[augmentations]] in early alpha testing phases, but also as final recipients, animals are similarly sought after as [[metahumans]], with the line between a cybered farm animal - such as a guard dog - and a [[biodrone]] becoming more and more blurred. [[MCT]]s [[Parashield]], [[General Genetics Worldwide]] of [[AG Chemie]], and other [[megacorporations]] are doing research here as uninhibitedly as they can (or rather should) afford to do with [[metahumans]].

More on this in the [[biodrones|corresponding article]].

===Cyborgization===
This technology, which [[Mitsuhama]] brought to the attention of the interested public with his anthropomorphic drones [[2065]], is the most extreme form of cyberization possible: the reduction of a metahuman to a brain, which is the central control unit of a [[drone]] body.  In addition to [[megacorporations]]s, [[underworld|syndicates]] such as the [[AsociaciÃ³n VÃ¡squez]] are interested in this technology - and in it so much that they want to build their own [[Delta Clinic]] for it.
	
More on this in the [[Cyborg|corresponding article]].

===Cybermantie===
Cybermantie describes extreme [[vercybert|verberation]], beyond the point of fatal [[essence]] loss, and the surgical procedures and magical practices required to achieve it. The products of the process are called [[cyberzombie]]s.

More on this in the [[Cybermantie|corresponding article]].

==Societal acceptance==

===Sports===
Cyberware in sports is still a touchy subject. Each sport handles it differently. Some ban it whole some have embraced it, many have struggled with it for a long time, and it is a constant balancing act. Much like [[magic]] and [[metatype]], cyberware is a fundamental unfairness, and the old, established sports of the [[Fifth World|Fifth World]] have had great difficulty adapting to the new realities of the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]].

====football====
Soccer - the world's number one favorite sport - is the last, almost completely uncyber sport. Virtually every type of [[augmentation]] is banned here. [[Cybereyes]] without unnatural enhancements and [[data jacks]] are accepted due to their prevalence, but any kind of active communication cyberware, eye enhancements, or any kind of bone, muscle, and reflex [[augmentations|augmentation]] are strictly forbidden.

This has to do not only with the fact that [[soccer]] is extremely popular in the cyberphobic parts of the world, but also with maintaining the myth that a kid from [[BogotÃ¡]] playing barefoot can make it to the top in soccer.

More in the article about [[soccer]].

====Basketball====
[[Basketball]] is the most conservative of the major [[North|American]] [[sports]]. Cyberware is only grudgingly accepted. [[Smartball]] systems were allowed after a long struggle {{shx|2047}}, but nothing that modifies range or body size is allowed. Minor [[reaction enhancement]]s, [[reflex boosters]]s, and [[artificial muscles]]s have also been grudgingly accepted.

More in the article on [[basketball]]

====American Football====
Unlike [[soccer]], [[American soccer]] has thrown itself fully into the arms of [[Sixth World|Sixth World]] [[Augmentations]] and [[metahumans]] found a place here very early on. The league has become more and more brutal, the field bigger and bigger, the ball and the injuries to the players heavier and heavier. Meanwhile, football could well pass for [[bloodsport]].

More in the article about [[Football]].

====Baseball====
The erstwhile All-American Pastime hasn't gone quite as far as its big rival [[Football]], but has nevertheless found its way into the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]]. Some cyberware finds use here - in addition to [[statsofts]] and [[talent lines]], there are even special [[cyberware]] tweaks for the [[cyberlimbs|cyberarms]] of players at different positions within a baseball team - such as the '''Louisville Slugger''' for the batter or '''Yankee Pitcher''' for the pitcher, named after popular NAL teams. The model name of the [[SpIn-X]] distributed by [[Spinrad Industries]] [[Reaction Enhancer|Fastball Pro Reaction Enhancer]] is also derived from a [[baseball]] term.

For more, see the article on [[baseball]].

===North America===
If cyberware has a home, it is arguably North America, specifically the UCAS, CAS, and parts of the NAN. No other area of the world has been as open to technological [[augmentations]] as here. Even [[Russia]] and [[Japan]], which were coined by [[Evo]], cannot keep up. Although many innovations in cyberware may come from [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], here they found interested parties who flaunted them in the open streets. Even in [[Tir Tairngire]], cyberware was at least tolerated.

This was in the {{shx|2050s}}. With the advent of cheaper and better [[Bioware|Bio-]] and [[Genware]] in the {{shx|2060s}} and [[Nanoware]] in the early {{shx|2070s}}, chrome lost much of its luster and went from cool to the choice of losers and bores. However, with [[KFS]] giving [[nanoware]] and [[genware]] a severe setback, it seems to be shining again - and the ubiquitous {{shx|2050s|50s}} revival is helping that as well.

The emerging policlub of [[purists]] is a worrisome development, though - very much in the direction of Catholic Europe and the Islamic world.

====NAN====
The [[NAN]] are divided in their stance on cyberware, but are generally the most cyber-skeptical states in North America. The larger tribes - Salish, Sioux, Cheyenne, Crow, Hopi, Ute - are all more or less open to cyberware. The [[PCC]] is considered the most open-minded.

Some of the smaller and more radical tribes in the NAN ban cyberware - and [[augmentations]] in general. However, these laws are not an expression of specific cyberphobia, but to preserve the holistic integrity of the [[essence]] of their tribal members. Accordingly, they urge [[vercybert]]ed visitors to leave as soon as possible. However, even truly radical tribes do not take legal action against them.

===Europe===
When it comes to cyberware, [[Europe]] is divided in two - along the lines of the Reformation Wars. This has to do with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]'s stance on [[augmentations]].

====Non-Catholic Europe====
Protestant parts of [[ADL|Germany]], [[Scandinavia]], German [[Switzerland]], parts of [[Austria]], and large parts of Eastern Europe are similarly open-minded to cyberware as [[North America]], although they maintain a more pragmatic attitude toward it. [[Great Britain|Britain]] also shares a more liberal attitude, although here there is much stricter regulation of exactly what cyberware may be worn.

Unlike [[North America]], [[KFS]] has had a more mixed reception here, and all [[augmentations]] have since been viewed somewhat more critically. No one is lynched for obvious cyberware, but tolerance for strange behavior by overtly [[augmented|augmented]]s has dropped noticeably.

====CatholicEurope====
Southern Europe, first and foremost [[Spain]], [[France]], the Catholic part of [[ADL|Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Salzburg]] ... here cyberware, except for medical reasons, or to [[Johnny Spinrad]], is decidedly unwelcome. That's not to say it's banned, but no one wants to see it here. Functional enhancements like [[rigger controls]] or [[data jacks]] are acceptable, as long as they're not flashy. But brushed-metal look-a-likes are a good way to be universally avoided. One exception was [[Portugal]], which has a more open attitude towards cyberware.

[[KFS]] has confirmed all prejudices here. There have been attacks on apparent augmenters in parts of southern Europe, there are edicts from the [[Vatican]] against [[monads]], and [[augmenters]] in general are now seen as a sin and partly sacrilege against God. And KFS is the just punishment.

====Euro-Elfenstaaten====
[[Pomorya]] and [[TÃ­r na nÃg]] occupy a special position. The two [[elven states]] have, from [[Paths of the Wheel|religious]] [[Pomorya#Religion:|reasons]] aversion to cyberware, but tolerate it in non-[[elves]]. Elves, on the other hand, must expect to have to frequently justify their handling of themselves. It goes without saying that local authorities keep a very close eye on such deviants.

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is a patchwork quilt. Islamic countries are even more hostile to cyberware than southern Europe's Catholics, some [[Chinese_successor|Chinese states]] the exact opposite, others somewhere in between. Often, this attitude depends a lot on who is in charge in the area in question at the time. However, [[Buddhism]] as a religion is more cyberpositive than many other religions, and [[Hinduism]] is not entirely hostile to [[augmentations]].

====Chinese-successor-states====
[[Asia]], particularly the war zones of the [[Southeast Asian War Zone|Southeast Asian War Zone]] and the [[Chinese_Successor States|Chinese Successor States]], is the largest market for [[Omegaware]]. Especially the Japanese [[megacorporations]] and [[wuxing]] like to flog [[omega ware]] or even defective series of their [[standard cyberware]] production here.

====Japan====
In cyberpositivity, [[Japan]] is not far behind [[North America]] and northern [[Europe]], but the Japanese culture of conformity and restraint then prevents such cyberculture, even if the cyberfetish subculture is nowhere wilder than here. Japan, however, is more open-minded about [[AI]]s than almost any other country.

====Korea====
A dynamic, reunified country trying to survive in a difficult environment between [[China]]s endless war of succession and the [[Japan|Imperial Empire]], [[Korea]] is extremely technophilic, and has been for decades. Cosmetic surgery has long been a way of life here, and [[Matrix]] and cyberware have also been embraced with a suitably open mind.

===Africa===
[[Africa]] is even more of a patchwork quilt than [[Asia]] when it comes to cyberware. From complete rejection of [[augmentations]] in magocratic tribal kingdoms to [[omegaware]]-saturated slums to secretive techno-cults, there is almost everything here. In most regions, however, cyberware is really hard to come by, even [[omegaware]].

====Gold-and-Ivory-Coast====
Along the impoverished and desolate anterior Gold Coast, [[piracy]], lawlessness, and a concomitant utilitarian view of cyberware prevail. Here, [[omegaware]] is the standard, and even [[standard cyberware]] is coveted. Many [[megacorporations]] make a good living knocking off their junk production here. In addition to military weaponry, deals that include a cyberization in a corporate facility are the [[pirate]]s used by many [[privateers]]s working on [[tribal gold and ivory coast|Gold and Ivory Coast]] Piracy with corporate "letters of marque" preferred form of payment.

====Ãthiomalian territories====
Here, too, government structures are still rather tenuous, but with [[Zion Amalgamated]] there is a bizarre hybrid of corporation and cult that evolved from a clinic center from the days of the [[VITAS]] pandemics, and whose developments rival the best that the [[megacorporations]] have. Among them is [[augmentations|augmentation]], particularly [[vercybert|vercyberation]], a lifestyle.

===Islamic world===
In Sharia law countries, and thus for many devout Muslims around the world as well, it is forbidden by {{WP|Fatwa}} to replace healthy tissue with cyberimplants. It is considered ungodly to mutilate the body. Nonetheless, people appreciate the benefits of good prosthetics. However, the {{WP|Ulama}} argue about implants that could decisively prolong life, such as a heart.

Nevertheless, there are definitely differences here: while the [[Arab Caliphate|Arab Caliphate]] does not admit [[augmentations|augmented]] to [[Mecca]], and [[Iran]] also has a hard time with [[Sixth World|Sixth World]], [[Turkey]], [[Dubai]], and [[Morocco]] are open to at least medically necessary [[augmentations]] and largely tolerate them in infidels.
