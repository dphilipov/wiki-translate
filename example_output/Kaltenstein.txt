'''Kaltenstein''' is a [[Great Dragon|great]] [[Western dragon|western]] [[Dragon]] from the [[Alliance of German Countries|ADL]].

==Biography==
After his awakening, he {{Shx|2012}} came into conflict with [[Mist Lord]] and [[Lofwyr]]. This was because the [[Bundeswehr]] pursued the dragon [[Feuerschwinge]] into [[SOX]] , where she was shot down. Kaltenstein, who tried to assist her over the English Channel and follow her into the irradiated zone, was prevented from doing so by another dragon, [[Nebelherr]]. A dogfight ensued between the dragons over [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], which Nebelherr nearly lost had [[Lofwyr]] not come to his aid. The dogfight shifted south, and together the two defeated Kaltenstein, who is said to have subsequently gone into hiding in the Black Forest {{Ref|1}}.
{{shadowtalk|Heavily injured smeared and hit like a meteor in the fir forest is more accurate.... {{Ref|1}}|'''''[[Arvenger '49]]'''''|62%}}
Many believed that he was killed in the process, but this was a fallacy {{Ref|2}}.

After his first sighting in 2012, Kaltenstein allegedly supported several projects of [[BUND]] and [[GreenWar]] in the years {{Shx|2017}}-{Shx|2020}}. It is further said to have emerged from the [[North Sea]] slimy with algae on {{Shx|13._March|13.03.}}{{Shx|2021}}, and damaged several ships in the port of [[Bremen]] before moving on to Hamburg, where it sank more ships and destroyed the [[Hamburg Ölhafen|oil port]]. This was - according to rumors - his reaction to the decision of the North Sea Conference to finally abandon the North Sea as contaminated {{Ref|3}}. Later, he is said to have financed the construction of the [[Altsterpalast]] with the imposing tower of the [[Nixenhotel]] with gold from his hoard (or from shipwrecks on the bottom of the North Sea) and to have acquired the [[Nixenbar]] in [[Hamburg]], even if officially not he but the [[Nixe Betriebsgesellschaft m.b.H.]] is the owner.

===Troll wars===
It is believed that Kaltenstein was heavily involved behind the scenes in the [[Troll Wars]], in which the southern German [[Troll]]s fought for their own country. Thus, the [[Trollthing]] formed under the guidance of the Grand Dragonend and served as magical support to King [[Berthold I]] during the battles. It is believed that the animists, under the guidance of the trollish [[druid]]n [[Vosegus]] (from vo-sego, ''the great power'') and under the guidance of Kaltenstein, triggered the earthquakes in the Upper Rhine Rift, as a result of which the volcanoes of the [[Eifel]] erupted and destroyed [[Karlsruhe]]. Furthermore, it is also believed that Kaltenstein not only founded the group, but also created the original, raw [[magical tradition]] of [[troll shamanism]] {{Ref|4}}.

Kaltenstein also destroyed {{Shx|2038}} the [[Zeppelin]] &bdquo;Lothar Späth&ldquo; over the Black Forest. {{Shx|2044}} he was one of the Great Dragons involved in the infamous formation flight over [[Munich]] and [[Stuttgart]] that forced the Hunggarten government of the [[Süddeutscher Bund|South German Confederation]] to abdicate.

Kaltenstein's [[Dragon's Lair|Hort]] is said to be located at Feldberg in the Black Forest, but he apparently {{Shx|2062|'62}} withdrew from the Troll Kingdom, abandoning that power base. Allegedly, a corporate team tried to loot the hoard after his (and Berthold's) disappearance, but the Troll Kingdom (and later the Troll Republic) has it very closely guarded.

===Threat against Switzerland===
After the illegal sterilization experiments of the [[GENOM Corporation]] in [[Basel]] on [[metahumans]] became known, Kaltenstein massively threatened the [[SEg]] and is said to have taken active action against the Kon. He also allegedly met with high-ranking representatives of the [[UN]] Commission on Metahuman Empires in [[Geneva]]. He has presumably been staying in the [[Swiss]] [[Alpine Interdict Zone]] ever since {{Ref|5}} {{Ref|6}}

===Dragon Civil War===
During the [[Dragon Civil War]] in the mid {{Shx|2070s}}, he maintained neutrality, and strongly opposed [[Alamais]]'s attempt to take him for his ''rebel'' camp. At the [[Dragon Assembly]] following Alamais' death in [[GeMiTo]], he attended but abstained from voting {{Ref|7}}.

In June {{Shx|2079}}, he destroyed a [[drone]] belonging to the [[Württemberg]]s [[Landwehr]], which the latter intended to use against troll extremists occupying the Triberg region. However, since he subsequently did not attack the Landwehr troops themselves, but flew to Triberg and landed there, he may have intended his action to force a willingness to negotiate.

==Agenda==
As the founder and patron of the [[Troll Kingdom of Black Forest|Troll Kingdom of Black Forest]], he has long been interested in protecting the Metanation {{Ref|8}}

The Great Dragon's name is always part of many shadow discussions, which center around the fact that he probably wants to secure metahuman rights while eliminating toxic threats. According to some rumors, he seems to have an ongoing interest in the [[SOX]], which is related to his dislike of [[Toxic Magic]]. Presumably, this can be traced back to {{Shx|2012}} {{Ref|2}}. {{Shx|2078}}, he is said to have been seen flying over SOX more frequently.

==Appearance==
Kaltenstein has blue-green-silver scales and is also known as a water dragon. He is physically even larger than Lofwyr, and has a stiff leg due to an injury sustained in his crash in the Black Forest.

===Metahuman form===
In [[metamensch]]l form, Kaltenstein is an impressive, old [[troll]]-[[mage]] or -[[sorcerer]] with a full white beard and long, white hair as well as sea-green eyes. The characteristic of limping also distinguishes him in troll form, which is why you never see him there without an extremely massive walking stick. In troll form he is 2.65 m tall and weighs 350 kg.

==Relationships==
===Berthold I.===
About the nature of Kaltenstein's pact or alliance with the now lost and declared dead Troll King Berthold exist various speculations, but no established facts. Individual conspiracy theorists like the Shadowland user "[[Panic!]]" have even speculated in [[Shadowland]] boards that the [[troll]] was the Great Dragon in [[metahuman|metahuman]] form. form. - However, this does not seem very credible {{Ref|9}}.

===Hans Bruhl===
A connection is also said to exist between Kaltenstein and [[Hans Bruhl]], a [[magical prodigy|magical wunderkind]] from near the Black Forest. The young man appeared practically out of nowhere at the [[University of Cologne]] and earned his doctorate in [[magic theory]] in the record time of two years, joining the [[Doctor Faustus Society]] and campaigning against the pollution of the Rhine by [[corporations]]. As a result, he became a political climber within the [[USPD]]. According to information from a [[magic detective]] named [[Marcel Black]] circulated in the [[Shadow Matrix]], Bruhl may have spent seven years in Kaltenstein's care {{Ref|10}}.

===Monika Stüeler-Waffenschmidt===
[[Monika Stüeler-Waffenschmidt]], CEO of [[Frankfurter Bankenverein]], [[Drake]] and foster daughter of [[Nachtmeister]], had literally caught a black eye from Kaltenstein in the past, presumably when she was looking for a new teacher {{Ref|11}}.

===Other dragons===
[[Feuerschwinge]] was Kaltenstein's mate while alive, and her loss is said to have been closer to the Grand Dragon than one would expect with these inherently solitary and territorial creatures. The fact that she crashed in the [[SOX]] has led to a lingering and at times downright unhealthy interest in the radioactively contaminated exclusion zone on Kaltenstein's part.

Kaltenstein's relationship with [[Lofwyr]] is quite strained - not only because of the dragon fight over [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] in {{Shx|2012}} and Lofwyr's role as [[Saeder-Krupp|S-K]]-[[CEO]] and thus responsible for one of Europe's biggest polluters. Apart from the presumed joint action of "flying the kite" over [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]], which sealed the end of the [[Süddeutscher Bund|South German Confederation]], there is no sign of cooperation between the two Big Dragons. Most importantly, Kaltenstein does not seem to approve of Big L's involvement in the Troll Republic after Kaltenstein's withdrawal, and has probably sent him a clear message to keep a lower profile there.

Because of Kaltenstein's strained relations with Lofwyr, [[Alamais]] apparently believed he could draw the Big Dragon into his camp in the wake of the [[Dragon Civil War|Dragon Conflict]] in the {{Shx|2070s|2070s}}. He therefore sought him out personally in the Swiss Alps, but was unable to persuade Kaltenstein to abandon his neutrality.

The [[Seattle]] resident [[Dragon]] [[Kalanyr]] was allegedly formerly a protégé and vassal of Kaltenstein, and possibly even a direct descendant of the German Great Dragon. In [[Redmond]] and there in particular in [[Glow City]] he researched - probably on behalf of Kaltenstein - potential ways to purify the SOX, but in the meantime he probably only pursues his own agenda. It remains to be seen whether Kaltenstein will eventually take action to remind him of his duties.

===Contradictions:===
According to "[[Datapuls: Hamburg]]" (p.13) he rose from the North Sea on {{Shx|19 May}}. This may be a misspelling, since the older "[[Germany in the Shadows II]]" (p.234) names the {{Shx|29._May|29. May}}. The older work gets priority at this point.
